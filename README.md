# AirPollutionAnalysis
In this project, a comprehensive methodology has been developed to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of air pollution across India and its potential impact on public health. The spatial analysis employs a Bayesian approach using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach to model the spatial distribution of air pollution efficiently. For temporal analysis, ARIMA/SARIMA models are utilized to forecast pollution levels over time. Furthermore, the relationship between pollution levels and health factors is explored using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), considering both Poisson and Quasi-Poisson distributions to model count and rate data effectively. The project integrates diverse statistical methodologies to provide a holistic understanding of the complex relationship between air pollution and public health, utilizing primary pollution datasets alongside supplementary health data. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, model formulation, and exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful insights into the dynamics of air pollution and its implications for public well-being.
Over the analyzed states, diverse trends in air pollution levels emerge, reflecting regional dynamics and influencing factors. Delhi, notorious for high pollution levels, showcases a consistent upward trajectory in PM_10 concentration from 2008 to 2015, driven by factors like vehicular emissions and industrial activities, alongside adverse meteorological conditions. Conversely, Jammu and Kashmir demonstrate relatively stable pollution levels with minor seasonal fluctuations, primarily influenced by winter heating sources. In contrast, Tamil Nadu exhibits a declining trend in pollution levels, interspersed with seasonal variations. SARIMA models fitted to each state's data provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities, aiding in understanding temporal pollution dynamics and guiding policy interventions. 
Spatial analysis, employing Bayesian modeling with INLA and SPDE approach, reveals higher pollution levels in northern states, gradually decreasing over the years due to government interventions and awareness programs. Temporal analysis, using ARIMA/SARIMA models, highlights varying pollution trends among states, with Delhi showing high pollution levels, Kerala exhibiting seasonal behavior, Tamil Nadu displaying a decreasing trend, and Jammu and Kashmir experiencing an upward trend. The statistical modeling part investigates the relationship between air pollution and health, finding significant correlations for Tamil Nadu, and Jammu Kashmir, while Delhi and Kerala show no clear associations. The best-fit models, identified as GAM with Poisson for Tamil Nadu and GAM with quasi-Poisson for Jammu and Kashmir, demonstrate reasonable convergence and predictive accuracy. However, limited health data size poses challenges to model reliability. Future research should focus on obtaining larger, more representative datasets to enhance the accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses, enabling more effective policy interventions to mitigate air pollution's impact on public health.
